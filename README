# Generalized Sparse Blocks

This library is the result of my diploma thesis for the Department of
Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki. It introduces a new sparse matrix storage format after which the
library is named. However, a number of other storage formats are implemented
and hopefully the library could be usefull to anyone intersted in research related
to the SpMV routine.
